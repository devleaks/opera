An Identity is the base class for named entity in the emitpy application.
It  contains the following mandatory attributes:
- A Organisation Identifier `orgId`
- A Class identifier `classId`
- A Type identifier `typeId`
- A name `name`

(Those four attributes were inspired years ago by a IBM IoT naming scheme and allow for fine flexible naming and classification.)
