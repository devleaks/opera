A Movement is an abstract container for the displacement of a vehicle
- either an aircraft through a flight,
- or a ground support equipment providing a service.

It is a list of successive positions with movement-related information at each position (speeds, etc.)

## Movement Building
During the construction of the movement, performances of the vehicle is taken into account to determine speed at vertices. In all cases, to simplify, linear acceleration and deceleration is used.
(I.e. there is no "force" computed from aicraft trust and varying aircraft mass (since it burns fuel), etc. just simpler realistic kinematics.)
Movement is created using Syst√®me International of unit. However, some values may be displayed in more commonly used imperial or aeronautical units like flight level.

## Movement Mark
Movement contain a list of remarkable points called *Marks*. A Mark in a movement is a named point in time in the movement. For example, for a flight, there is a Mark for each flight phase: Off-Block, takeoff-hold, takeoff, top of climb...
The most important data for a Mark is its time relative to the start of the movement.

## Movement Time
The movement always start at relative time zero. All times of a movement is relative to its start. Each Mark in the movement will have a time of occurrence relative to the start of the movement.

When a Movement is created, its positions can be [[Emit, Schedule, Format|broadcast]].
