Runway usage is closely monitored through the emitpy application.
A Runway is "busy"
- when an aircraft is cleared for landing until it leaves the runway at a runway exit,
- when an airicraft is clear for take-off until it reached a critical point at 3000ft ABL and accelerate.

It is thereby possible to monitor runway usage.
The momnitored usage is theoretical, because mostly based on "scheduled" times and not estimated ones.
