To enhance movement realism, emitpy needs a few named points of interest as destination.
It is not possible to find those points in any database.
We recommand using a tool like geojson.io to create a GeoJSON FeatureCollection with all named point. Point must be attached a few GeoJSON Feature properties to properly identify them.

# Aeroways

## Runway Exit
Runway exits are difficult to identify (need network analysis).
For smiplification, it is advisable to provide a list of runway exits on either side of the runway.
When an aircraft ends its landing roll and reaches a speed of about 50km/h (~Â 30kn) or less, it may exit the runway towards the network of taxiways.
Runway exit points are named after the runway: RW34L:exit:5L is the same as RW16R:exit:3R
