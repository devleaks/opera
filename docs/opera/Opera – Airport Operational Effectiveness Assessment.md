Airport Opera estimate the operational effectiveness of an airport by looking at vehicle ground movements, both aircrafts and ground support equipments.

Vehicle ground movements are monitored through [[Rule|Rules]]. When a Rule is matched, data is saved,  analyzed, and displayed on the operational dashboard.
