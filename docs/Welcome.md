#intro 

Airport Opera is a software tool to estimate an airport's operational effectiveness.

[[Opera – Airport Operational Effectiveness Assessment|Airport Opera]] proceeds from observation of aircrafts and ground support vehicles movements. From those observations, quantified observables are created and constantly monitored.
They are compared to past values, thereby providing an array or possible trends and evolutions of a current situation.


# Emitpy: ADS–B Track Generator

To help develop Airport Opera [[Emitpy – ADS-B Track Generator|emitpy]] is a ADS-B track generator that simulates aircrafts and ground support vehicles ADS-B message broadcasts. It is used to generate deterministic sets of data for development purposes. Since artificially generated, sets of data can exhibit challenges and controlled behaviours to developers.
